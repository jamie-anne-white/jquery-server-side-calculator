## Description
Description
Duration: Weekend Challange

This is a server side calculator where a user can submit an input of x and y, it those inputs are sent to the server. The inputs and the calculations are then displayed onto the webpage where users can see the history of the calculations they have made without being able to access information on the client side of the app. 

This calculator provides a way for the server to store the data that was put in my a user while it does not allow them to see the backend calculations that are occurring. This can potentially provide for more security for the information being submitted by a user. 

## Software

Node.js
Express
Postman (for checking during the creation process)

## Installation
How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example -- Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the .env file.

Create a database named your database name,
The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
Run npm run server in your terminal
Run npm run client in your terminal
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!
